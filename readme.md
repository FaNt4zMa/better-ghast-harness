### ⚡ Speed Boost While Riding
Mount up and feel the difference! Each reinforced harness grants your ghast a flying speed increase **only when you're riding**:

- Copper: **+25% speed**
- Gold: **+50% speed**
- Iron: **+75% speed**
- Diamond: **+100% speed**
- Netherite: **+200% speed**

### 📖 Enhanced Enchantments
To compensate the Ghast's lack of equipment, tiered harnesses support all **Protection enchantments** at **2.0x their normal power**:
