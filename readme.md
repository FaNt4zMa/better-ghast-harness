- Reinforced I: **+25% speed**
- Reinforced II: **+50% speed**
- Reinforced III: **+75% speed**
- Reinforced IV: **+100% speed**
- Reinforced V: **+200% speed**

### 📖 Enhanced Enchantments
To compensate the Ghast's lack of equipment, Reinforced harnesses support all **Protection enchantments** at **1.5x their normal power**:
