Each tier provides **balanced protection** for your ghast, with iron being stronger than gold and netherite offering exceptional endgame defense. Crafting is **flat progression** - skip straight to any tier you want without needing the previous ones!

### ⚡ Speed Boost While Riding
Mount up and feel the difference! Each reinforced harness grants your ghast a flying speed increase **only when you're riding**:

| Tier | Speed Boost | Actual Speed |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| Copper | +25% | ~5.6 blocks/s |
| Gold | +50% | ~8.1 blocks/s |
| Iron | +75% | ~11 blocks/s |
| Diamond | +100% | ~14.4 blocks/s |
| Netherite | +200% | ~32.5 blocks/s |

> **Note:** Due to how Minecraft's flying speed attribute works, higher tiers feel disproportionately faster than their percentage suggests - this is intentional! The netherite harness in particular provides a dramatically powerful boost for endgame mobility.

### 📖 Enhanced Enchantments
To compensate the Ghast's lack of equipment, tiered harnesses support all **Protection enchantments** at **2.0x their normal power**:
